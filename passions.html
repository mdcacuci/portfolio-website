                <h2>Robotics</h2>
                <p class="text2">For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated by robotics and all things mechanical. The thought of completing any task at the press of a button, as a way to improve the quality of life is amazing to me and something I want to be a part of. In middle school I was a part of a two-person VEX IQ Robotics Challenge Team that won the Create Award at the VEX Robotics World Championship. In high school, I have been a part of our school's First Robotics Challenge Team. </p>
