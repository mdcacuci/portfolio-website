                <h2>Robotics</h2>
                <p class="text2">For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated by robotics and all things mechanical. The thought of completing any task at the press of a button, as a way to improve the quality of life is amazing to me and something I want to be a part of. In middle school I was a part of a two-person VEX IQ Robotics Challenge Team that won the Create Award at the VEX Robotics World Championship. In high school, I have been a part of our school's First Robotics Challenge Team, as well as a mentor for youth VEX IQ Robotics Challenge and First Lego League Robotics Teams.</p>

                <h2>Piano</h2>
                <p class="text2">Piano has been a part of my life since I was five years old and continues to bring joy to me. I particularly enjoy music from the Romantic and Baroque periods. I am a frequent performer at school, church and senior centers. In hopes of reaching out to more people and inspiring their interest in classical music, in 2022 I created the BrainSTEMs Piano YouTube Channel. Over the years, I have received numerous awards from local, state, and national piano competitions and have received high scoring remarks on piano examinations from the Royal Conservatory of Music and National Guild of Piano Teachers. I hope to bring people joy through my music and performance.</p>

                <h2>Computer Science</h2>
                <p class="text2">Coding and computer programming is something that comes natural to me. I have self-studied and am proficient in Python, Java, HTML and CSS. I am currently one of the programmers on our robotics team and am working on an educational app aimed at youth. I have participated in a summer internship with a computer science faculty at California State University Fullerton where I developed machine learning models trained on different datasets and to make predictions using Python. I am also taking AP level computer science courses at my high school. I developed this website from scratch using HTML and CSS as a fun project.</p>

Well, in this video I go over some arithmetic tricks for multiplication, division, squaring, and square roots, that can cut the amount of time you spend doing problems in half.</p>

                <h2>Vanished Days Op. 57 No. 1 by Edvard Grieg</h2>
                <p class="text2">Edvard Grieg was a Norwegian Romantic composer, known for helping to develop a Norwegian national identity through his use of Norweigian folk music in his compositions. Grieg's works are noted for their refined and novel lyrical sense and spirited rhythms that show his characteristic sense of rhythm and harmony.</p>
